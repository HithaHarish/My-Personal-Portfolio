This is a personal portfolio website built using React with Vite for fast development, and a backend powered by Node.js and Express. The portfolio features 3D models and animations created with Blender and rendered using Three.js.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite** — Fast build tool and development server for React

while deploying, I have made it serverless using netlify functions.

/netlify/functions/contact is serverless backend 
/netlify/functions/health can be used to check if the backend is working fine
/backend/index has Node + Express App for backend Email logic
